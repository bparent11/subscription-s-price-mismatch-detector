# subscription-s-price-mismatch-detector
Code that is helpful to detect people who paid something (for example a place to a concert) with the subscription's price of an association for example (which is preferential) whereas they weren't.

I use this code to my personal needs. For confidentiality issues I can't show you the dataset on which I use it, that's why I created fake data in order to let people see that the code is working well.
You can also get the email of people who haven't paid with the good option, but I didn't include it in my fake data even I can ensure you that is working very well.

I will note my code as soon as possible to help you to understand easily it, but I'm really busy currently.
